raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming.

raylib installer package for Windows provides all the required tools preconfigured 
to start coding games/graphics/tools with raylib in a few seconds.

raylib Windows installer package installs raylib by default in: C:\raylib 
Directory is self-contained and portable, including all required tools:

 - raylib 5.5 library with source code, examples and several preconfigured projects
    > https://github.com/raysan5/raylib
 - Notepad++ 8.7.1 64bit (npp) 64bit preconfigured with some scripts to compile raylib and examples
    > https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus
 - w64devkit 2.0.0 (GCC 14.2.0 - 64bit), portable C and C++ Development Kit for Windows
    > https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit
 - emsdk 3.1.71 - Emscripten C compiler for WebAssembly
    > https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk

A "Notepad++ for raylib" shortcut is created on desktop on installation and when the program is first opened, 
it opens raylib.h header file, for API reference, and core_basic_window.c example. 

Pressing F6 should open NppExec script system to compile and run the example.

It's recommended to check other examples on raylib/raylib/examples as learning material.
